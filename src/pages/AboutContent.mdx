I've worked at a few neat places:

* [**Second Half Games**](https://secondhalf.games) (2022—current) on [Shanty of the Stallion](https://secondhalf.games/shanty) and [MEANWHILE IN SECTOR 80](https://ms80.space)
* [**Uplift Games**](https://uplift.games) (2020—2021) on the hit game [Adopt Me!](https://playadopt.me)
* [**Roblox**](https://www.roblox.com) (2017—2020) where I created projects like [Roact](https://github.com/Roblox/roact)
* [**Gecko Designs**](https://www.geckodesigns.com) (2015—2017) on pilot websites for some major brands
* [**Univision Computers**](https://univisioncomputers.com) (2011—2014) where I got my start!

I'm the creator of [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo) and its related projects.

I've been working in the Rust game development ecosystem. I maintain some libraries in that space:
* [yakui](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/yakui), a declarative UI library aiming to bridge the gap between prototype and production-quality UI
* [Thunderdome](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/thunderdome), a generational arena implementation
* [Crevice](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/crevice), a library that aids laying out data for use in shaders
