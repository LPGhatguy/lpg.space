I write software, play Magic: the Gathering, and enjoy the great outdoors. I am a strong believer in accessible software, welcoming communities, and free educational resources.

I've worked for a few companies:

* **Unannounced Game Studio** (2021—current)
* [**Uplift Games**](https://uplift.games) (2020—2021) on the hit game [Adopt Me!](https://playadopt.me)
* [**Roblox**](https://www.roblox.com) (2017—2020) where I created projects like [Roact](https://github.com/Roblox/roact)
* [**Gecko Designs**](https://www.geckodesigns.com) (2015—2017) on pilot websites for large brands like Gillette and Febreze
* [**Univision Computers**](https://univisioncomputers.com) (2011—2014) where I got my start doing all sorts of stuff

I'm the creator of [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo), an important tool in the top Roblox developer community. It enables Roblox developers to leverage the large body of traditional software development tools. It has a few related projects like [rbx-dom](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rbx-dom) and [Remodel](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/remodel).

I've been working in the Rust game development ecosystem. I maintain some libraries in that space:
* [yakui](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/yakui), a declarative UI library aiming to bridge the gap between prototype and production-quality UI
* [Thunderdome](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/thunderdome), a generational arena implementation
* [Crevice](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/crevice), a library that aids laying out data for use in shaders
