During my winter vacation, I decided to start following along
with [Nora Sandler's Write a C Compiler series](https://norasandler.com/2017/11/29/Write-a-Compiler.html).

I've been interested in compilers for a long time, but besides making small esolangs and partial parsers for existing scripting languages, I've never sat down to build a compiler for a real language end-to-end.

I think Rust is a great language to author a compiler in, and it's great practice for developing my intuition with the platform too!

You can check out my progress so far, currently up to the end of part one, [on GitHub](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/rust-c-compiler).

Since the repository won't ever be a *useful* project, it exists solely as reference code, whether for other people following along with the series or just for those curious about Rust or compilers
