I built a fancy new site with some fun technology:

* Node.js
* Nginx as a reverse proxy
* React server-side rendering

I had been exceedingly frustrated waiting for GitHub Pages to support TLS for custom domains. Having a nice CDN with very little setup is nice, but HTTPS is becoming more and more of a hard requirement.

All-in-all, I'm impressed with the server-side performance of React 16, and having zero-latency page transitions is rad.

The development experience using React and my own templates is also significantly better than Jekyll. I gain hot-reloading and a lot of flexibility in how I construct my pages.

The price I pay for this is much more setup and maintenance, as well as hosting costs. I'm confident; we'll see if it pays off.
