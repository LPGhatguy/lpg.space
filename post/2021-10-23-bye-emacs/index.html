I was excited to see how extensible Emacs is and I can see why people have stuck with the editor for so long. I even tried to get some of my friends to come give it a shot.</p><p class="_p_007f8">The honeymoon is over. I gave up on Emacs.</p><p class="_p_007f8">A lot of my experience mirrors <a class="_a_007f8" href="https://thume.ca/2017/03/04/my-text-editor-journey-vim-spacemacs-atom-and-sublime-text/">this blog post from Tristan Hume</a>. I found it while looking for sympathy during the peak of my frustration with Emacs. It really helped validate my feelings during a time when I was blaming myself for Emacs' problems.</p><h2 class="_h2_007f8">The Good</h2><p class="_p_007f8">Emacs, especially Doom, has some awesome stuff going for it:</p><ul class="_ul_007f8"><li>Evil, by far the best Vim emulation in any non-Vim editor</li><li>Spacemacs-style keybinds are genius</li><li>A declarative package manager, <inlinecode class="_inlineCode_007f8">straight.el</inlinecode></li><li>Discoverability of functions is very good</li><li>Incredibly easy to extend the editor</li></ul><h2 class="_h2_007f8">The Bad</h2><p class="_p_007f8">Over time, I ran into more and more issues.</p><p class="_p_007f8">Startup time on my fast desktop was over 5 seconds. Opening a Rust file would freeze the editor for 3 seconds. Even the input latency on buffers with any features enabled was unbearable. I am told this is unique to Emacs on Windows.</p><p class="_p_007f8">I spent a lot of my time with Emacs figuring out why stuff was broken. Why did Treemacs get into a busted state so frequently? Why would some stuff replicate across persp-mode workspaces? Why can I sometimes get my cursor into the LSP suggestions window and edit it? Doom was supposed to be a curated set of packages and patches to make them all work together, and yet they often did not.</p><p class="_p_007f8">Packages monkeypatch functions that get monkeypatched by other packages that invoke some hooks in an order that sometimes changes. I ended up reading a lot of Emacs Lisp trying to figure out why something small like line numbers refused to work.</p><p class="_p_007f8">Doom Emacs has a cool upgrade process and uses <inlinecode class="_inlineCode_007f8">straight.el</inlinecode> for its packages. Over 8 months, I tried to upgrade Doom four times and did not succeed once. Each time, I would hit a new unique internal error and restart my Doom install from scratch.</p><p class="_p_007f8"><a class="_a_007f8" href="https://twitter.com/evaeraevaera">Eryn</a> would frequently poke fun at how my editor was janky and broken.</p><p class="_p_007f8">By the end of my time with Emacs, I was depressed. I thought I had found the end-all editor, the last one I would ever use, and it would be infinitely customizable! In reality, it was slow, often broken, and it made me not want to program anymore.</p><h2 class="_h2_007f8">The Now</h2><p class="_p_007f8">I bought a Sublime Text 4 upgrade and switched back to my old ways, mostly.</p><p class="_p_007f8">It's painfully obvious how much faster Sublime Text is than Emacs. The editor opens instantly. Files open instantly. I can type and the editor usually doesn't freeze.</p><p class="_p_007f8">I learned the fundamentals of the Sublime Text plugin API and wrote a couple plugins. It turns out that's pretty easy. I even changed some of my bindings to be more Spacemacs/Doom-like.</p><p class="_p_007f8">Programming is fun again and I spend zero time waiting for a frozen editor or fiddling with monkeypatching a package's obscurely-named functions.</p><p class="_p_007f8">I'm happy again.</p></div><div></div></article></div></div><footer class="_Footer_c92f1"><div class="_FooterInner_c92f1"><span class="_Item_c92f1"><a title="LPGhatguy on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/LPGhatguy"><img class="_Icon_c92f1" src="/iconmonstr-twitter-1.4b3cbcb7.svg"></a></span><span class="_Item_c92f1"><a title="LPGhatguy on GitHub" href="https://github.com/LPGhatguy"><img class="_Icon_c92f1" src="/iconmonstr-github-1.54a762db.svg"></a></span><span class="_Item_c92f1"><a title="Lucien Greathouse on LinkedIn" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucien-greathouse-539bb73b"><img class="_Icon_c92f1" src="/iconmonstr-linkedin-3.a124480b.svg"></a></span></div></footer></div> <script src="/src.8e9f9de6.js"></script> </body></html>
