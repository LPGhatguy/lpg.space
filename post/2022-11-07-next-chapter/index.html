I will no longer be maintaining Rojo and other Roblox-related projects. There will be one more release of Rojo sometime in the next few weeks.</p><p class="_p_007f8">In the coming months, I'll be launching a new game studio. Stay tuned for more on that in the future.</p><p class="_p_007f8">I created Rojo in 2017. It is currently the de facto build tool for Roblox projects and has thousands of users across the platform. I'm proud of creating Rojo. It's been a gateway for Roblox developers to learn traditional software tools as well as a road onto the platform for developers from other ecosystems. Rojo enabled new workflows that weren't possible before.</p><p class="_p_007f8">Before I started Rojo, I felt that there was something fundamentally wrong about Roblox's relationship with traditional developer tooling. I had a vision for how I felt people should work on Roblox games and I pushed for it. That vision resonated with some people and put me in direct, very heated conflict with others. Working at Roblox and making a public push towards a specific Roblox developer experience was a bad combination.</p><p class="_p_007f8">Rojo ended up being at the center of why Roblox let me go in mid 2020. My relationships with people at Roblox working on Studio were bitter and hostile. I was labeled the "ringleader of engineering dissent." Several of my friends were relocated onto new teams and shown the door. For the damage caused to friends and others, I'm sorry.</p><p class="_p_007f8">My participation in Rojo's development since then has been intermittent and has slowed down. There have been a handful of amazing contributors creating features and fixing bugs, but my role has become just showing up every few months to merge PRs and cut a release. I can no longer give Rojo the attention it needs.</p><p class="_p_007f8">Rojo was never intended to be a long-term project. When I bought the <inlinecode class="_inlineCode_007f8">rojo.space</inlinecode> domain, I joked with my friends that I would only register it for two years. At that point, I would either abandon Rojo or it would be built into Roblox. Five years later, there has been no progress towards a Roblox-official version of something like Rojo.</p><p class="_p_007f8">This is the right move for me and is overdue. I hope that Rojo serves as a good foundation for the next generation of developers who want to solve the same problems that I did.</p><p class="_p_007f8">To everyone who supported me working on Rojo all these years, thank you.</p><p class="_p_007f8">See you on the far side.<br>
